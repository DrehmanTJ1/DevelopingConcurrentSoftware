Tools for this course
=====================
The following tools will be used in this source:

1. Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Desktop
2. Git
3. Github
4. Google Test

Visual Studio 2012
------------------
Any version of Visual Studio 2012 which compiles C++ will work. I'm using Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Desktop. It can be downloaded [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34673). After downloading it, perform a full installation.

If you are not using Windows, any C++ compiler with support for the C++11 threading library will work.

Git
---
Git is a distributed version control utility. On Windows, I'm using MsysGit from [here](http://msysgit.github.io/), version 1.8.3.

Github
------
Github is a website which provides free Git repository hosting, code sharing, and code review. I'll be pushing all of the code and notes for the course to Github.
